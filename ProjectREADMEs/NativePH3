///////////////THIS IS OLD///////////////////////////
in the createfinal folder, I sorted all three lists by their first column, removed the two extra files in the mat charges files, and then pasted all the files together as required. This folder is where the final results for the job are in

[Aditya@MoDRN createfinal]$ diff ph2 mat2
452a453
> 134523-03-8
1711a1713
> NOCAS_48176

I deleted these two files from the mat charges file to create the lists, because they are not present in the sdf charge files (either native or ph073)

sort -k1 finalnativelist > sortednative
sort -k1 finalpHlist > sortedpH
awk '{print $1, $2}' matcharges > matprefix
awk '{print $2}' sortednative > sortednativevalues
awk '{print $2}' sortedpH > sortedpHvalues
paste matprefix sortednativevalues > nativealmostdone
awk '{print $1, $3, $2, $2 - $3}' nativealmostdone > FINALNATIVE
awk '{print $1, $3, $2, $2 - $3}' pHalmostdone > FINALPH
^note the interchange of the third and second columns, this means that the columns are in the correct order as requested (sdf in 2nd columns, mat in 3rd columns)
//////////////END OF OLD////////////////////////////////


The folder "FINAL" is where the real final outputs are
The folder started with finalnativelist, finalpHlist, and matcharges
(the two files 452a453
> 134523-03-8
1711a1713
> NOCAS_48176 were removed from matcharges for the same reasons described in the "OLD" section)

The following commands show the pipeline to FINALPH and FINALNATIVE

sort -k1 matcharges > sortedmatcharges
awk '{print $1, $2}' sortedmatcharges > nativematprefix
awk '{print $1, $3}' sortedmatcharges > pHmatprefix
sort -k1 finalnativelist > sortednative
sort -k1 finalpHlist > sortedpH
awk '{print $2}' sortednative > sortednativevalues
awk '{print $2}' sortedpH > sortedpHvalues
paste nativematprefix sortednativevalues > nativealmostdone
paste pHmatprefix sortedpHvalues > pHalmostdone
awk '{print $1, $3, $2, $2 - $3}' nativealmostdone > FINALNATIVE
awk '{print $1, $3, $2, $2 - $3}' pHalmostdone > FINALPH

FINALNATIVE and FINALPH are the final results of the "Charge Job".
